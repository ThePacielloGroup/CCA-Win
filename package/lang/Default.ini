lcr_note=1.4.2 Contrast (Minimum):  Text (and images of text) have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except if the text is pure decoration.  Larger scale text (at least 18 point or 14 point bold) or images of text can have a contrast ratio of 3:1. (Level AA)
lcr_note2=1.4.4 Contrast (Enhanced): Text (and images of text) have a contrast ratio of at least 7:1, except if the text is pure decoration.  Larger scale text (at least 18 point or 14 point bold) or images of text can have a contrast ratio of 5:1. (Level AAA) How to meet 1.4.4

brightness_pass=The difference in brightness between the two colours is sufficient. The threshold is 125, and the result of the foreground and background colours is %d.
brightness_fail=The difference in brightness between the two colours is not sufficient. The threshold is 125, and the result of the foreground and background colours is %d.

colours_fail=The difference in colour between the two colours is not sufficient. The threshold is 500, and the result of the foreground and background colours is %d.
